# Care-For-Me
Help your nonverbal companion

# Overview

## Purpose
### As a Client needing care, I sometimes have a hard time asking for it, or I may be nonverbal. I want it to be very simple for me to have my needs met.

### As a caregiver, I want to immediately know what my client's needs are. I would like reminders for regular tasks and the ability to make a schedule of regular tasks as well.

# User Types
### Client
My needs being met are my primary concern. Like anyone, I have social needs, physical needs, and emotional needs. Sometimes I have a hard time communicating. I want it to be easy for me to find the need I'm looking for, tap a button, and for a message to get sent to my Caregiver

#### Entry: 
The client's needs are shown in a set of horizontal collection views in a view that scrolls vertically

#### Notifications:
The client should receive notifications pertaining to their needs. 
1. Caregiver met need
  - This gives the client a chance to ask for the need to be met again if it wasn't met to their satisfaction
  - It gives the client peace of mind. Some clients are forgetful and may forget that their caregiver met their need 
2. Caregiver declined to meet need
  - The need may be unreasonable. The caregiver will be required to give a reason why they're declining the requested need 
3. It's been more than 30 minutes since I asked for my need
  - This gives the client the opportunity to ask for their need to be met again

### Caregiver
Making sure my client is well taken care of is my primary concern. My client has regular needs I'd like to be able to keep track of and I'd also like to know if my client needs something that isn't on the schedule. Some of my clients have a hard time communicating

#### Entry: A schedule showing today's needs and any outstanding needs from prior days. Tapping on a need allows the caregiver to make notes, mark the need as taken care of, and change the recurring frequency of the task.

#### Notifications: 
The caregiver should receive notifications pertaining to their client's needs
1. Scheduled need coming up (can change `n` minutes)
2. Scheduled need due now
3. Scheduled need missed
4. Client requested an unscheduled need

### Common:
These are in both user cases

#### Needs:
Both users can create needs. The caregiver can determine if it will be a need the client can request, a scheduled need, or both.

#### Settings:
Notifications: On/Off
